# Basic-techniques-of-Image-Processing
These are some experiments using basic image processing techniques.

Problem statements:
1) Design a checkerboard with user-defined size and intensities.
2) Using RGB channels for a given garden image, extract grass and flowers separately.
3) Convert a RGB (colored) image into a grayscale image.
4) Segmentation using clustering
5) Image Enhancement
6) Secret Image Encoding
